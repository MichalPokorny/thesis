COBT migration plan:

* [DONE] Rewrite OFM to handle generic value size.

  COBT stores O(log N) chunks of key-value pairs together, so a static size
  is not enough anymore.

* Rewrite COBT to store all OFM nodes as atomic units, not OFM blocks.

  COBT right now stores minima of OFM leaf nodes. COBT needs to store
  keys of all OFM nodes. Note that after the migration is finished, the
  memory usage will remain the same, because now the COBT will be referring
  to all N/log N OFM cells.

* Add cobt_from_sorted API.

  This will be needed to perform reconstruction when we need to store larger
  pieces in OFM chunks.

* Write final COBT.
