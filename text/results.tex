\section{Cache-oblivious B-tree}
FIXME: COBT is reasonably fast

\section{Self-adjusting structures}
FIXME: splay trees are fast
FIXME: K-splay is slow, K-forest is even slower

The measured perfomance of $k$-forests was even worse than $k$-splay trees,
both while backing $k$-forests with B-trees and cache-oblivious B-trees.
Choosing a larger $k$ slightly helped, but larger values of $k$ also degenerate
$k$-forests into their backing structure. As expected, $k$-forests do exhibit
the working set property, but simple structures without the working set property
outperformed $k$-forests several times on working set tests.

\section{Hashing}
FIXME: cuckoo, linear probing is good
