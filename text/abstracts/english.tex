In this thesis, we implement several data structures for ordered and unordered
dictionaries and we benchmark their performance in main memory on synthetic
and practical workloads. Our survey includes both well-known data structures
(B-trees, red-black trees, splay trees and hashing) and more exotic approaches
($k$-splay trees and $k$-forests).
