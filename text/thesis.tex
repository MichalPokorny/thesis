% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
	In this thesis, we implement several common and uncommon
	data structures for ordered and unordered dictionaries and we benchmark
	their performance in main memory.

	To illustrate the importance of cache-aware design in modern computers,
	we benchmark hand-optimized \mbox{B-trees} against more traditional data
	structures (red-black trees and hashing).
	Cache-oblivious algorithms can take advantage of the memory hierarchy
	without explicit hand-tuning. We also implemented a cache-oblivious
	equivalent of \mbox{B-trees} and compared its performance to hand-tuned
	\mbox{B-trees}.

	Self-adjusting data structures, like splay trees, are difficult to
	reconcile with block operations in a memory hierarchy: for example,
	splay trees perform $\O(\log N)$ amortized memory reads from
	unpredictable locations on every \textsc{Find}, where \mbox{B-trees}
	only need $\O(\log_B N)$ cache misses.
	Splay trees are probably the most common self-adjusting dictionary.
	We compare their performance with non-self-adjusting structures and
	with more exotic self-adjusting structures designed for block memory
	access ($k$-forests and $k$-splay trees).
